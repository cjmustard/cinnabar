# Experimental Cinnabar extensions

This is a developer spike, off by default. It proves a typed WASM component
boundary, retained JSON-UI output, one local input action, bounded execution,
quarantine and hot reload. It is not a supported marketplace or a vanilla feature.

## Build and run the sample

From the repository root, with the Rust toolchain pinned by the repository:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo build -p hello-mod --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --locked
cargo run -p mod-host --locked -- pack \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/hello_mod.wasm /tmp/cinnabar-hello.wasm
cargo run -p mod-host --locked -- probe /tmp/cinnabar-hello.wasm
cargo run -p mod-host --locked -- bench /tmp/cinnabar-hello.wasm
CINNABAR_MOD_COMPONENT=/tmp/cinnabar-hello.wasm cargo run -p bedrock-client --features local-mods --locked
```

Route local builds through the shared limiter as required by
`docs/agents/multi-agent-workflow.md`. No Go core or server is needed for `probe`,
`bench` or the tests. Launching the client still requires its normal pinned carriers.
No mod is loaded without an environment selection or enabled local registration; builds without `local-mods`
do not compile Wasmtime and ignore it with a warning.

The last command opens the launcher. Select a server only in a separately
authorized live session. To exercise the same startup switch, scheduled adapter,
window-focus check and F8 action entirely offline, run:

```sh
CINNABAR_MOD_COMPONENT=/tmp/cinnabar-hello.wasm \
  cargo test -p bedrock-client --features local-mods --lib configured_sample_drives_the_app_adapter_offline --locked
```

During gameplay, F8 changes the label. UI focus and window focus suppress the
action. Without the additional gameplay grants below, the mod cannot generate
camera input, chat, packets or world mutations. Rebuild
the guest and package to a temporary sibling file, then atomically rename it over
the selected component to reload. Reload resets guest state and commits the new
label only after initialization succeeds; a broken replacement keeps the previous
instance. A runtime trap removes its label and disables callbacks until a changed,
valid component is loaded.

## Visual time changer

`environment.set-time-override(option<u32>)` accepts a fixed tick within one
Bedrock day; `none` immediately restores tracked server time. Access is denied by
default; `ModGrants.environment` grants it per instance. The developer component
switch grants it explicitly. Writes are bounded and transactional; quarantine
clears the override and successful reload starts fresh. Only atmosphere and light
inputs consume it: server clock updates and simulation continue, with no packets.
The override stays fixed regardless of the server daylight-cycle rule.

`examples/mods/time-changer` starts at `Time: Server`; F8 cycles Day, Sunset,
Night, Midnight, then Server. Night uses the vanilla night preset, distinct from
midnight. Build with the already installed `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target (otherwise
install it separately with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`):

```sh
cargo build -p time-changer-mod --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --locked
cargo run -p mod-host --locked -- pack \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/time_changer_mod.wasm /tmp/cinnabar-time-changer.wasm
cargo run -p mod-host --locked -- probe-environment /tmp/cinnabar-time-changer.wasm
CINNABAR_MOD_COMPONENT=/tmp/cinnabar-time-changer.wasm cargo run -p bedrock-client --features local-mods --locked
```

Use the shared build limiter for every cargo command, as for hello. The last
command opens the launcher; the existing offline adapter and snapshot commands
also accept this component. The dedicated offline cycle/no-packets test is
`configured_time_changer_is_visual_only_offline` with `CINNABAR_MOD_COMPONENT` set and
`--features local-mods`.

Vanilla time uses six presets, preset-table lookup and modulo 24000, including
celestial time wrapping. The vanilla 1.26.50.4 pack's
`texts/en_US.lang:3665–3671` identifies the time preset labels;
`:1993–1995` describes freezing the daylight cycle. Existing atmosphere math remains
subject to its current parity limits; this mod adds no native acceptance claim.

## Contract and implementation

### Opt-in gameplay API

Personal developer components may request `gameplay.read-frame()` and
`gameplay.rotate(yaw-delta, pitch-delta)`. Both capabilities are denied by
default, independently of the visual time grant. Explicitly opt in at startup:

```sh
CINNABAR_MOD_COMPONENT=/tmp/my-mod.wasm \
CINNABAR_MOD_PLAYERS=1 CINNABAR_MOD_CAMERA=1 \
  cargo run -p bedrock-client --features local-mods --locked
```

On PowerShell, set the corresponding `$env:CINNABAR_MOD_*` variables before
launching the client. Only the exact value `1` grants access. These grants apply
only to the explicitly selected personal component, not to server bundles.

`read-frame` returns an error without the players grant, or `ok(none)` outside
active gameplay. A snapshot contains the actor session, dimension, local subject
eye position, actor yaw/pitch, frame duration in seconds, held semantic attack
action and up to `mod_api::MAX_GAMEPLAY_PLAYERS` remote player feet positions.
Positions are world block coordinates; angles and rotation deltas are radians
in the actor's YXZ convention: positive yaw turns left, positive pitch turns up.
Nearest players come first, with runtime ID breaking distance ties. The local
player, mobs, non-finite positions and player-list entries without loaded actors
are excluded. Runtime IDs are session-scoped. These are committed actor positions,
not interpolated render poses; the list does **not** assert line of sight,
on-screen visibility, friendship or server permission.

`rotate` requires the separate camera grant and a current gameplay snapshot.
It adds to physical look in the same frame, before movement, physics and camera
publication. The sum of accepted writes per axis must remain within
`mod_api::MAX_CAMERA_DELTA_RADIANS`; non-finite or excessive deltas are rejected.
The app retains its existing pitch limit and preserves subject position and roll.
There are at most eight read calls and eight rotation calls per callback; exceeding
either budget traps the guest. Output is committed only after a successful
callback and consumed once. Initialization, loss of gameplay authority, a trap or
successful reload cannot leave a rotation queued for a later frame.

The app provides no gameplay frame when the window is unfocused, the cursor is
released, a screen owns input, no world is connected, an acceptance camera is
running, or a server camera is active. The default client still installs no
extension systems. A camera write changes the local actor's look; the normal
movement/network path may report that look to the server. This is not a
presentation-only override and carries no server approval claim.

A guest can use `attack-held` to choose between continuous assistance and
assistance only during the attack action, and `frame-seconds` to scale a strength
setting independently of rendering speed. Target selection and strength remain
guest policy; this API does not install an aim-assist algorithm. No process memory,
OS input synthesis or vision model is needed.

`crates/mod-api/wit/extension.wit` is the single interface definition. The guest
SDK uses `wit-bindgen`; the host independently generates Wasmtime bindings from
that same file. Copy `examples/mods/hello` to start a mod, adjust its dependency
path, and implement its generated `Guest` trait. `pack` converts the core WASM
module and embedded WIT metadata to a component. The guest's actual imports
declare its requirements; unknown imports fail linking. The prototype's
grant is HUD, the demo action and environment for the developer-selected mod,
with separate explicit opt-ins for gameplay reads and camera writes. It has
no marketplace permission prompt or signed package format.

The host admits no WASI, filesystem, network, Bevy or GPU import. Gameplay data
arrives only as a bounded app-owned snapshot, not a world handle. Each
callback receives a fresh fuel budget and publishes at most one validated label
and one visual time override, plus one current-frame camera delta when granted.
Resource limits are defined in `crates/mod-host/src/lib.rs` and `runtime.rs`.
Invalid text is rejected; labels are plain text and cannot carry formatting codes.
The label's original host-owned JSON template goes through the existing JSON-UI
engine and compiled carrier. Guest strings never become JSON or binding expressions.

The app integration sits after semantic input finalization and before UI
publication, between physical look and movement. Without an active selection it
installs no guest runtime or gameplay output. A `local-mods` build watches its
local registration on a background worker; default builds have no watcher.
Required vanilla carriers remain required. The extension adds no protocol types
or dependencies on gameplay state to the component host.

## Personal controls and interaction

Three additional per-component grants are opt-in: `CINNABAR_MOD_CONTROLS=1`,
`CINNABAR_MOD_INTERACTION=1` and `CINNABAR_MOD_SETTINGS=1`.
They are developer extension capabilities and do not change the vanilla client.

`panel.set-content` retains a bounded JSON panel of toggles, sliders, buttons and
choices. It uses the host's JSON-UI engine; guests cannot provide templates or
binding expressions. Optional `style: "compact"` renders a unified menu with up
to three equal-height cards. Sections can select a bounded `icon` (`pointer`,
`crosshair`, `ruler`, `settings` or `none`). A `keybind` control has `id`, `label`,
`key` and optional `capturing` fields; pressing its keycap emits a button event,
and the guest owns key capture and reservations. Key changes retain geometry.
Choices open a host-owned option list. Slider numbers open a bounded text editor;
Enter applies finite values within the declared range and normalizes the step.
Escape or an outside click cancels an editor before closing the panel. Keyboard
input belongs to the editor while it is open; reserved emergency and panel keys
retain priority. The existing choice/slider event payloads are unchanged.
Optional sections organize controls into category tabs and
cards; omitting them keeps a flat panel. `input.read-controls` supplies current-window physical key
edges and panel events. `input.reserve-keys` prevents selected bindings reaching
gameplay. The panel's `toggle_key` opens or closes it before the ordinary input
sample; Escape closes it. Other absorbing screens and lost focus close it, release
input, and suppress gameplay output. Removing or quarantining a guest releases
the panel and its reservations.

`gameplay.set-attack-reach` requests a current-frame actor selection/admission
range up to `mod_api::MAX_ENTITY_REACH_BLOCKS`. It preserves obstruction checks
and normal attack transactions; the server still decides whether a hit is valid.
`gameplay.pulse-attack` requests one press only while the captured semantic Attack
action is physically held. Neither operation synthesizes OS input. These requests
commit after a successful guest callback and expire each frame.

`settings.load/save` reads or atomically replaces only the selected component's
`.settings.json` companion. JSON objects and file reads are bounded by
`mod_api::MAX_SETTINGS_BYTES`; there is no guest-selected filesystem path.
Successful callbacks commit settings in memory immediately. One worker coalesces
atomic disk writes, reports failures separately, and flushes the last value on exit.

With an explicit component and controls grant, `CINNABAR_MOD_FONT` may select a
bounded local outline font for the personal panel. It is rasterized once per
selected font into an isolated atlas alias with filtered sampling. Panel sizing follows display DPI
independently of the game GUI scale; vanilla and server glyph ownership are preserved.

## Custom rendering

`render` is a separate local grant (`CINNABAR_MOD_RENDER=1`, or `"render": true` in
`local-mod.json`); depth reads also need `render_depth`. Budgets live in `mod_api`.

- **Post passes.** `register-pass` takes WGSL that defines
  `fn effect(uv: vec2<f32>) -> vec3<f32>` against a host prelude (`scene`, `param`,
  `blur`, `bloom`, `world_to_uv`, and `depth` or `world_position` with depth). naga
  validates the composed module. The guest may not declare resources, overrides or entry
  points, and may not loop. Worst-case texture reads and expressions per pixel, with call
  sites expanded, must fit the budget, as must source size, tokens per statement (which
  bounds nesting) and the size of every type. Validation runs on its own thread, and a frame
  callback may compile one shader. A rejection returns the reason to the guest. Passes
  run by `(order, name)` after post-processing and before the HUD, each reading the
  previous colour. `update-pass` retains an enable flag and 16 floats, and disabled passes
  cost nothing, and replaced or reloaded passes release their pipelines. Each slot is
  timed as `gpu_mod_pass_N`.
- **World primitives.** `draw` appends decals, ribbons, beams and billboards for the
  current callback. Each successful callback replaces the drawn set; an identical set
  rebuilds and uploads nothing. One premultiplied,
  depth-tested draw without depth writes runs in the transparent phase, timed as
  `gpu_mod_primitives`.
- Both commit only after a successful callback. A trap, reload, revocation or unload
  clears them.

### Render sample

`examples/mods/render-sample` registers a vignette pass, which F8 toggles, and draws a
pulsing ring at the player's feet:

```sh
cargo build -p render-sample-mod --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --locked
cargo run -p mod-host --locked -- pack \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/render_sample_mod.wasm /tmp/cinnabar-render.wasm
cargo run -p mod-host --locked -- probe-render /tmp/cinnabar-render.wasm
CINNABAR_MOD_COMPONENT=/tmp/cinnabar-render.wasm CINNABAR_MOD_RENDER=1 CINNABAR_MOD_PLAYERS=1 \
  cargo run -p bedrock-client --features local-mods --locked
```

Replacing the component reloads it as for other mods. A rejected shader shows its error as
the mod's label.

## Mobs, camera rig, commands and cues

`CINNABAR_MOD_ENTITIES=1` grants `gameplay.read-mobs`: up to
`mod_api::MAX_GAMEPLAY_MOBS` non-player actors within `MAX_MOB_RANGE_BLOCKS` of the
eye, nearest first, with type ID and replicated health. `gameplay.set-camera-rig`
(camera grant) retains a third-person boom in camera-local blocks plus roll and FOV
change, swept against blocks like the vanilla boom; it presents third-person-back
until `none`, a trap or a reload. `CINNABAR_MOD_COMMANDS=ability` (comma-separated)
lets `gameplay.request-command` send `/ability ...` as a vanilla player command
request; any other command is refused, and requests are capped by
`MAX_COMMANDS_PER_FRAME` and `MAX_COMMANDS_PER_SECOND`. `events.emit` publishes bounded
cues in the app's `ModCueFeed`; `events.poll` returns last frame's cues, at most
`MAX_INCOMING_CUES`. `input.read-controls` also reports held keys. All output commits
only after a successful callback and is dropped on a trap or reload.

## Several mods at once

`CINNABAR_MOD_SET=/abs/mods.json` loads up to `mod_api::MAX_LOADED_MODS` components,
each with its own grants (the `local-mod.json` names), budgets, trap quarantine and hot
reload. A component that fails to load is skipped:

```json
{"version": 1, "mods": [
  {"component": "/abs/camera.wasm", "grants": {"players": true, "camera": true, "controls": true}},
  {"component": "/abs/hud.wasm", "grants": {"environment": true}}
]}
```

File order settles conflicts: the earliest camera rig, rotation, time override, attack
reach and non-zero packet delay win; a key reserved by an earlier mod never reaches a later
one; the first mod with a panel owns it; labels join with ` | `; commands and cues keep load
order. Render passes merge by name with the earliest mod keeping a contested name, and passes
and each primitive kind fill the single-mod budgets in load order. Each mod polls
every mod's previous-frame cues. The set takes precedence over `CINNABAR_MOD_COMPONENT`
and the registration watcher, which still load a single mod.

## Attach a local component to a running client

A `local-mods` build watches `local-mod.json` in `InstallLayout.user_config_root`
(on an installed Windows client, `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Cinnabar/`). Write it atomically:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "request_id": "local-request-1",
  "enabled": true,
  "component": "C:/Local/mod.component.wasm",
  "font": "C:/Local/panel.ttf",
  "grants": {
    "environment": false,
    "players": true,
    "camera": true,
    "controls": true,
    "interaction": true,
    "settings": true,
    "render": false,
    "render_depth": false,
    "entities": false,
    "commands": []
  }
}
```

The registration is bounded to 16 KiB, paths must be absolute, and grants default
to false. Component compilation, source polling, font rasterization and status
writes run on the worker. The current generation is installed before physical
input sampling; deleting, disabling or invalidating the registration revokes its
runtime and restores input ownership. A request-ID-only change preserves guest
state. An environment-selected component takes precedence over registration.

`local-mod.status.json` reports the request ID, client PID and `loaded`, `error`
or `disabled` state. `loaded` acknowledges actual installation, rather than only
successful compilation. The guest still has no filesystem or process access.
This loader cannot be added to an executable that is already running without it;
older clients require one update and restart.

## Verification and limits

```sh
cargo test -p mod-host --locked
cargo test -p bedrock-client --features local-mods --lib modding --locked
cargo test -p bedrock-client --lib mod_hud --locked
```

To capture the real compiled sample through the existing offline renderer:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/cinnabar-mod-frames
CINNABAR_FORM_SNAPSHOT_DIR=/tmp/cinnabar-mod-frames \
CINNABAR_MOD_SNAPSHOT_COMPONENT=/tmp/cinnabar-hello.wasm \
  cargo test -p bedrock-client --lib mod_spike_snapshot_with_real_carrier --locked -- --nocapture
```

This writes before, initial-label and keybind PNGs without starting a network
session. The test requires the real carrier when a snapshot directory is set.

Measure the real CPU UI build with zero mods and with the sample loaded:

```sh
CINNABAR_MOD_SNAPSHOT_COMPONENT=/tmp/cinnabar-hello.wasm \
  cargo test -p bedrock-client --lib mod_spike_offline_frame_overhead --locked -- --ignored --nocapture
```

This alternates warmed baseline/sample batches at the same viewport and reports
both totals and paired differences. It includes the guest callback, label adapter
and JSON-UI build; it excludes Bevy scheduling, reload polling, rasterization and
GPU work. Default builds install zero extension systems. These development
profile measurements are diagnostic, not a release frame-budget acceptance test.

The host tests execute actual components, including traps, endless loops,
memory growth, missing authority and failed/successful reloads. The Rust sample
is independently built to WASM and exercised with `probe` and the snapshot test; native workspace tests
alone do not prove guest code generation. `bench` reports warmed batch per-frame
idle and action crossing costs with fuel checks, excluding compile, disk polling, JSON-UI and GPU
costs. Its development-profile figures are spike evidence, not a release frame
budget or vanilla performance acceptance.

This in-process spike cannot contain compiler OOM, host defects or runtime native
crashes. Environment-selected reload compilation and file reads remain synchronous;
registration loading uses its bounded worker. Before admitting downloaded
mods, move compilation/execution to a restricted helper with process memory/time
limits, bounded IPC and watchdog restart. Recheck the runtime's security support
and advisories before release. The design also requires signed packages, explicit
permission grants, revocation, a server policy protocol and cross-platform tests.
There is no claim of server approval or native visual acceptance.

HUD visibility remains incomplete: the existing vanilla data source hardcodes
HUD-visible bindings and alpha. The spike suppresses its label for focus, menus,
loading and a statically hidden underlying HUD, but does not yet follow vanilla
hide-GUI, partial server HUD visibility or animated opacity. See `plan.md`; the
hidden-HUD test is not full visibility parity evidence.

## Loaded block highlights

The separate `block_highlights` grant (`CINNABAR_MOD_BLOCK_HIGHLIGHTS=1`) permits
`render.set-block-highlights`. A retained specification names up to
`mod_api::MAX_BLOCK_HIGHLIGHT_IDENTIFIERS` canonical block identifiers, a bounded
camera-relative range, and linear RGBA colour. The host scans only loaded primary
block layers, caches palettes and subchunk identities, and draws full unit cubes
through terrain without changing world or packet state. Results share the
`mod_api::MAX_BLOCK_HIGHLIGHTS` nearest-block budget; the earliest active mod wins.
`none`, unload, reload, or a trap clears the overlay. Output commits only after a
successful callback; repeated unchanged input rebuilds no geometry.
## Fullbright

The separate `fullbright` grant (`CINNABAR_MOD_FULLBRIGHT=1`) permits
`environment.set-fullbright`. Enabling it replaces the shared world light table
with full illumination without changing time, stored lighting or server state.
Disabling it restores the current environment. The flag is retained after
successful callbacks and clears on traps, unload and reload. Unchanged input
uploads no new table; inactive world sessions suppress the override.

Block highlights inspect received primary block layers even while collision
readiness is incomplete. Missing subchunks and unloaded data remain excluded.


## Local movement input

The separate `movement` grant (`CINNABAR_MOD_MOVEMENT=1`, or `"movement": true`
in a component registration) exposes `gameplay.read-movement` and `pulse-jump`.
The snapshot belongs to captured gameplay and contains its session, dimension,
simulation tick, velocity in blocks per tick, ground contact, physical held jump,
ordinary walking eligibility and local knockback sequence. No snapshot is retained
across callbacks. Snapshot validation rejects mismatched authority and non-finite velocity.

`pulse-jump` stages a single ordinary jump input only while walking is eligible and
physical jump is released. The request commits after a successful callback and is
consumed once by the next physics tick. Focus loss, menus and authority changes
revoke pending input; no velocity or movement rule is changed. Jumping remains
subject to the simulator's ground contact and jump cooldown rules.

`cancel-jump` commits an explicit cancellation even outside gameplay, allowing a
component to revoke a sub-tick pulse as soon as its module is disabled. Cancellation
wins over jump pulses in the same callback and never clears physical jump input.
